# Import Data


```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
```

The data were obtained from https://natural-resources.canada.ca/maps-tools-and-publications/publications/minerals-mining-publications/canadian-mining-assets/canadian-mining-assets-cma-country-and-region-2020-and-2021/15406. The table was copy-pasted into a CSV file, and the column headers were manually renamed to facilitate importing the data.

```{r}
mining_data_raw = read.csv("./canadian_mining_data/mining_data.csv")
```
